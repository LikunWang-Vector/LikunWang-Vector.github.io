## Introduction

As I complete my Master's degree at Waseda University's Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, I want to share my research journey that combined biomechanics, topology optimization, and deep learning.

## The Research Question

My research focused on a fascinating question: **Can we use AI to predict the mechanical behavior of bio-inspired structures?**

Specifically, I studied fish vertebrae - nature's elegant solution for lightweight, high-strength structural design. These structures have evolved over millions of years to optimize the balance between strength and weight.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition
Using CT scanning technology, I acquired high-precision 3D models of fish vertebrae. This provided the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

### 2. Finite Element Analysis
With COMSOL Multiphysics, I performed detailed structural simulations to understand how forces distribute through these complex geometries.

### 3. Topology Optimization
I applied topology optimization techniques to explore the structural principles that make fish vertebrae so efficient.

### 4. Deep Learning Integration
The key innovation was introducing a deep neural network to predict loading forces, significantly improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Key Results

- **20%+ improvement** in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods
- **Significant reduction** in computational time
- **Novel insights** into bio-inspired structural design principles

## Lessons Learned

1. **Interdisciplinary thinking** is crucial for innovative research
2. **Combining traditional engineering with AI** opens new possibilities
3. **Nature provides excellent templates** for engineering solutions

## What's Next

I'm now applying these skills as an Algorithm Engineer at Shenzhen Suanhai Technology, focusing on TPU operator development and toolchain optimization. The interdisciplinary mindset I developed during my Master's continues to guide my work.
