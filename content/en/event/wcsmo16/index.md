summary: Oral presentation on fish vertebrae loading force prediction using topology optimization and deep learning.
abstract: 'This research presents a novel framework for predicting loading forces applied on fish vertebrae structures by combining topology optimization techniques with deep neural networks. Using CT scans to acquire high-precision 3D data of fish vertebrae, we performed finite element analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics and topology optimization to explore lightweight structural properties. A deep learning model was introduced to predict loading forces, achieving over 20% improvement in calculation efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional methods.'
