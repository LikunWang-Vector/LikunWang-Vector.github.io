abstract: This research presents a novel framework for predicting loading forces applied on fish vertebrae structures by combining topology optimization techniques with deep neural networks. Using CT scans to acquire high-precision 3D data of fish vertebrae, we performed finite element analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics and topology optimization to explore lightweight structural properties. A deep learning model was introduced to predict loading forces, achieving over 20% improvement in calculation efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional methods. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the potential of combining bio-inspired structural analysis with modern AI techniques for enhanced predictive capabilities in biomechanical systems.

summary: A novel framework combining topology optimization and deep neural networks for predicting loading forces on fish vertebrae structures, achieving 20%+ improvement in efficiency and accuracy.
