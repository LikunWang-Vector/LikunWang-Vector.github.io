### Introduction

Our previous scraping projects were small-scale and completed quickly. But we'll face a practical question: what if we need to scrape thousands of data items? Looping through thousands of pages executing code sequentially is clearly inefficient. How can we improve efficiency? That's what we'll discuss.

### Overview

There are many ways to speed things up.

For example, when doing several tasks, we can coordinate them to run simultaneously, saving time. This can be implemented in computers - it's called multithreading.

Alternatively, we can have friends help us, each doing one task, also saving time. This can also be implemented in computers - it's called multiprocessing.

As shown, n-thread execution efficiency is at least n times that of single-thread, greatly saving time.

There are other methods to improve efficiency, such as coroutines and asynchronous scraping.

We'll cover these topics in the following chapters.
