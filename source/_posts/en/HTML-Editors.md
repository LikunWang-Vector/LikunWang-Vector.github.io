### Using Notepad or TextEdit to Write HTML

You can use professional HTML editors:

- Adobe Dreamweaver
- Microsoft Expression Web
- CoffeeCup HTML Editor

However, we recommend using a simple text editor to learn HTML, like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). Using a simple text editor is a great way to learn HTML.

Follow these four steps to create your first web page with Notepad.

### Step 1: Start Notepad

How to start Notepad:
- Start
- All Programs
- Accessories
- Notepad

### Step 2: Edit HTML in Notepad

Type HTML code in Notepad.

### Step 3: Save the HTML

Select "Save As" from Notepad's File menu.

When saving HTML files, you can use either .htm or .html extension. There's no difference - it's entirely your preference.

Save the file in an easy-to-remember folder, like HTML_Learning.

### Step 4: Run the HTML File in a Browser

Start your browser, then select "Open File" from the File menu, or double-click your HTML file in the folder.

Note: In practice, I found that PyCharm is also great for writing HTML code. You can create new HTML files and customize HTML templates, saving many tedious steps. I'm learning HTML to deepen my web scraping knowledge, so I can edit both scraping code and HTML in the same editor - very convenient for lazy people like me!
