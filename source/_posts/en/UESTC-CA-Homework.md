## Computer Architecture Homework Solutions

### Chapter 1-2 Homework

**1. Describe the characteristics of the four types of computer system architectures in Flynn's classification.**

**Answer:**

Flynn classifies computer system architectures into four categories based on different combinations of instruction streams and data streams:

1. **SISD (Single Instruction Stream Single Datastream)**: Traditional sequential processing computers

2. **SIMD (Single Instruction Stream Multiple Datastream)**: Represented by array processors

3. **MISD (Multiple Instruction Stream Single Datastream)**: There are different views on what actual computers this represents

4. **MIMD (Multiple Instruction Stream Multiple Datastream)**: Multiprocessor and multicomputer systems belong to this structure
