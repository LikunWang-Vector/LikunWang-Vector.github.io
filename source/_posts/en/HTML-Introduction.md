### What is HTML?

HTML is a language used to describe web pages.

- HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
- HTML is not a programming language, but a *markup language*
- A markup language is a set of *markup tags*
- HTML uses *markup tags* to describe web pages

### HTML Tags

HTML markup tags are commonly called HTML tags.

- HTML tags are keywords surrounded by *angle brackets*, like `<html>`
- HTML tags usually come in *pairs*, like `<b>` and `</b>`
- The first tag in a pair is the *start tag*, the second is the *end tag*
- Start and end tags are also called *opening tags* and *closing tags*

### HTML Document = Web Page

- HTML documents *describe web pages*
- HTML documents *contain HTML tags* and plain text
- HTML documents are also called *web pages*

Web browsers read HTML documents and display them as web pages. Browsers don't display HTML tags, but use them to interpret page content:

#### Example Explanation

- Text between `<html>` and `</html>` describes the web page
- Text between `<body>` and `</body>` is the visible page content
- Text between `<h1>` and `</h1>` is displayed as a heading
- Text between `<p>` and `</p>` is displayed as a paragraph
