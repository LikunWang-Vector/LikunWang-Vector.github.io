## Four Elements of Software Project Management

> **The "Four Ps"**:
> - **People**: Personnel
> - **Product**: The software product
> - **Process**: Comprehensive plan for software development
> - **Project**: The project itself

---

## Team Organization Styles

> **Democratic Decentralized (DD)**: Problems and method decisions are made by group consensus, no permanent leader, horizontal communication among team members.
>
> **Controlled Decentralized (CD)**: Team has a clear leader who assigns tasks, with secondary leaders responsible for subtasks. Group activities for problem-solving, solutions implemented by team leader. Both vertical and horizontal communication occurs between groups and individuals.
>
> **Controlled Centralized (CC)**: Internal problem-solving and coordination management are handled by a good team leader. Communication between leader and team is vertical.

---

## Virtual Teams

> **Definition**: Teams that span time, space, and organizational boundaries, using communication technology to strengthen connections.
>
> (Network teams, parallel groups, project development teams, production or functional groups, Offshore ISD teams...)
>
> **Advantages**: Improved productivity, expanded market opportunities, knowledge transfer
>
> **Disadvantages**: Insufficient communication, poor leadership, management issues, incompetent team members

---

## Software Scope

> Environment, Information Objectives, Functions, Performance

---

## Project Planning

> Based on future project decisions, project execution organizations select and formulate activities including project objectives, engineering standards, project budget, implementation procedures, and implementation plans. Project plans are not immutable.

---

## P-CMM Five Levels

> P-CMM (People Capability Maturity Model) describes and grades human resource management modules such as HR planning, compensation management, performance management, organizational management, career planning, training management, and knowledge management across five progressive levels: **Initial, Repeatable, Defined, Managed, and Optimizing**.
>
> This establishes an evaluation model for enterprise HR management maturity, used to rate current HR management status, identify gaps and shortcomings, and clarify future development directions.

## Chapter Summary

- Software project management is an important part of software engineering: it starts before any technical work begins and runs throughout the entire process of software definition, development, and maintenance
- The four "Ps" have significant impact on software project management: People, Product, Process, and Project
- Product requirements must be determined through communication with customers and developers; partitioning (decomposition) of product requirements into components allows the software development team to organize work appropriately
- Select a common process framework, apply an appropriate software engineering model, and choose a set of work tasks to accomplish project work
