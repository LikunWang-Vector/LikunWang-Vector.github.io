Who else witnessed this? Today in the kirodotdev/Kiro repository on GitHub, I had the rare privilege of watching a top-tier operation disguised as "righteous whistleblowing" but actually functioning as "free advertising."

This hero with the ID **@MicoMiOvO** (let's call them "Little O") single-handedly turned **Issue #4734** into the community's spotlight. Let's take a moment to send some (sarcastic) appreciation from the community to this noble "whistleblower."

### 1. Top-Tier "Intelligence Dealer": Helpfully Providing the Address

Normal person reporting a vulnerability: *"Hey, the registration API lacks rate limiting. Might want to fix that."*

Little O reporting a vulnerability: **"Everyone look! The Linux Do community already has a mature Kiro AWS protocol registration bot! I've basically given you the address, and scalpers have already registered thousands of accounts!"**

Impressive awareness. Little O was so worried people wouldn't know where to get the registration bot that they not only clearly stated the source but also vividly described the "grand spectacle of scalpers registering hundreds to thousands of accounts." This isn't vulnerability reporting - this is basically **"A Practical Guide to Exploiting Free Trials: From Beginner to Expert"** class notes.

### 2. The Perfect "Product Reviewer"

In the Issue, Little O posted over a dozen screenshots (though the community collapsed them, the momentum was still there). Beautifully illustrated with clear logic.

If you didn't know better, you'd think Little O was Kiro's Chief Testing Officer, or perhaps the **"Global Ambassador"** for that registration bot. This spirit of "I'm really annoyed by this, but I absolutely must show every detail to the whole world" is truly a breath of fresh air in the open-source community. I'm moved to tears.

### 3. Translation: What Does "Seriously Affecting Paying Users" Really Mean?

Little O wrote indignantly in the description: "This seriously affects paying users!"

**Subtext translation:**

- **Option A:** I'm a distinguished paying user, and it hurts to see others freeloading.
- **Option B:** I just bought an account and now the registration bot is public knowledge - how am I supposed to resell this at a markup?
- **Option C:** I'm currently using the registration bot, but I'm worried too many people will drain the pool. Better get the author to close the door so I can enjoy this solitude alone.

This noble sentiment of **"getting on the bus and immediately asking the driver to weld the doors shut"** really demonstrates selfishness... oh wait, I mean "collective honor" to its fullest.

### 4. Friendly Tips for the Author

Facing such "enthusiastic" community members like @MicoMiOvO, the author shouldn't sit idle:

- **Step 1:** Follow Little O's intelligence to browse Linux Do. You might be able to match Little O's ID with the registration bot's core code.
- **Step 2:** While patching the vulnerability, remember to award Little O a "Best Promoter Award." After all, without their announcement, many people might not have known how easy Kiro was to exploit.

### Conclusion

We should thank @MicoMiOvO. They've shown us through action: **Real hackers never attack directly - they just open an Issue on GitHub and conveniently include a location.**

This "self-destructive" style of reporting satisfies vanity while, due to its high virality, successfully transforms what might have been an obscure vulnerability into a "public secret" known across the entire internet.

**Little O, next time you open an Issue, just put the registration bot download link directly in the README. Save everyone the trouble of searching Linux Do - that's exhausting!**

Enjoy the drama responsibly.
