### Color Values

A color is defined by a hexadecimal notation, which consists of red, green, and blue values (**RGB**).

The minimum value for each color is 0 (hexadecimal: **#00**). The maximum value is 255 (hexadecimal: **#FF**).

### Color Names

Most browsers support a set of color names.

Tip: Only 16 color names are supported by the W3C HTML 4.0 standard. They are: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow.

If you want to use other colors, you should use hexadecimal color values.

### Web Safe Colors

Years ago, when most computers only supported 256 colors, a set of 216 Web Safe Colors was suggested as a Web standard. The reason was that Microsoft and Mac operating systems used 40 different reserved fixed system colors (approximately 20 each).

I'm not sure how meaningful this is today, as more and more computers can handle millions of colors, but the choice is still yours.

#### 216 Cross-Platform Colors

Originally, the 216 cross-platform web safe colors were used to ensure that all computers could correctly display all colors when using a 256-color palette.
